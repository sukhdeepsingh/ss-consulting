Bioinformatics Scientist at [HZPC Research B.V.](https://www.hzpc.com/) where I have been creating and managing advanced Bioinformatics infrastructure to assist in state of art plant breeding.

My research experience includes Epigenetics, plant/mammalian Bioinformatics, marker discovery, genome assemblies and addressing complex scientific questions using computation. I have developed scalable computational pipelines to handle and analyze genomics big data employing High-Performance computing. 

I have led sundry high value projects including infrastructure development, grant acquisition, Agile based customized project solutions with several visualization paradigms and HPC/cloud deployments. I have substantial experience with team building, global networking, public relations, innovation and technology scouting. I have worked in diverse settings where I have gained extensive computational, leadership, independency and entrepreneurial/corporate skills in a broad range scientific international environment.
