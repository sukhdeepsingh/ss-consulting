  We provide several layers of functional information and detailed genomic insights on shared and specific roles of Set1C and Mll1-2 and the dynamics of transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in the ground, primed and differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) states. Our future endeavors will be to map the effect of absence of enzymes constituting the Set1/Trithorax-type H3K4 methyltransferases, in the developed layers, which will help to deduce further involvement of these enzymes and their specific roles, finally investigating how do they contribute to changes in the epigenetic landscape in mESCs
  Responsibilities include:
  
  * Creating, maintaining and updating of automated ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq computational pipelines for handling and analysis of NGS data-sets utilizing High-Performance Computing (HPC).
  * Deeper downstream analysis to investigate and understand the biological complexity underlying the single or multiple datasets using Gene-Ontology enrichment, Pathway analysis to more complex network analysis.
  * Writing reports, method articles and papers to be reviewed in the peer-reviewed journals.
  * Collaborating with several scientists and researchers locally and globally on various themed projects.
  * Software and web-application development
  * Generation of simple to sophisticated publication quality figures using a wide variety of visualizations.
  * Submission and sharing of large datasets across various portals and collaborators along with depositing to GEO and other data archives.
  * Bioinformatics support for project design and data analysis consultation.
  * Presenting work at various national and international conferences, meetings and workshops in the form of talks, live demos and posters.
  * Associated SYBOSS where the aim is to understand how a simple stem cell becomes a highly specialised member of a network, and how those conditions could be recreated in treating disease.
