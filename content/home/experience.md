Our future endeavors will be to map the effect of absence of enzymes constituting the Set1/Trithorax-type H3K4 methyltransferases, in the developed layers, which will help to deduce further involvement of these enzymes and their specific roles, finally investigating how do they contribute to changes in the epigenetic landscape in mESCs."""
